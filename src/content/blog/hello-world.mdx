Hi! If you haven't figured it out yet, I'm Matthew. In a few weeks, I will be a student at the University of Waterloo, but for now, I'm a summer intern at BMO that watches *Jeopardy* in the evenings and *Real Time with Bill Maher* on Fridays. In my spare time, I'm coding, playing the piano, listening to history podcasts, following the stock market, and reading (can't wait to drop half of these hobbies once I'm drowning in assignments in uni!).

What is the purpose of this blog, you might be asking? I haven't got a single fucking clue. I don't know what I will write about. I don't know how often I will write. I don't know how many people will read this (at least one, thanks to you ðŸ˜‰). But I know that I want a blog and now I have one. Anyways, there are a few other things I want to say but I think I will save those for another post. This is just a hello world post after all...

## Time Capsule

Although this blog may not serve a specific purpose, the time capsule does. At the bottom of each blog post, I plan on including some current events and the book I am currently reading for two reasons:

1. I want to make sure I am somewhat caught up with the news and that I keep reading.
2. I sometimes stumble upon the old blogs of other people and start reading their posts in chronological order. So if anyone from the future happens to be doing that with this blog, greetings from the past, and hopefully these news headlines will serve as a nice time capsule :)
