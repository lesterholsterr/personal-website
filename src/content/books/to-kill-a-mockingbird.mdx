I don’t have too much to say here. Even before reading the book, I had a vague understanding of the plot because of how often it gets referenced everywhere. It’s a coming of age story about a sister and brother raised by a single dad in 1930s Alabama. The kids grow up and learn about racial prejudice, empathy, lying, and the social conventions of the time through their own adventures and controversies in their town. 

My main problem with the book is that: other than the trial of Tom Robinson, the story kind of meanders. I understand the book has a lot of historical significance — it was published in 1960, highlighting the racial prejudice in America years before MLK’s *I Have a Dream* speech and years before the Civil Rights Act would be passed. I just don't think it hits the same today.
