*Humans: A Brief History of How We F*cked It All Up* begins with the now all too familiar premise that the human brain is not built for the modern world, but for the world we found ourselves in tens and hundreds of thousands of years ago. Phillips starts off with the usual list of stupid things our brains do: confirmation bias, availability heuristic, Dunning-Kruger effect… On a side note, at this point I have spent so much time reading *other* books citing Daniel Kahneman's *Thinking Fast and Slow* that I wonder if I could save time by actually reading *Thinking Fast and Slow* and skipping over any parts of future books that talk about it.

Anyways, the remaining chapters bucket human failures into different categories: humans vs nature, humans vs technology, humans vs humans… actually there were many many chapters about humans vs humans. Phillips used to be a writer for Buzzfeed UK, which might explain why each chapter (and sometimes even sections within a single chapter) feels like a totally distinct article with its own hook and witty conclusion. Not that I have anything against that; these days I find myself reading for shorter periods of time (i.e. thirty minutes on the way to and from work) and so these "non-cumulative" books are a lot easier to digest. Plus it's more obscure (and hilarious) historical events and figures to shove in the back of my brain.

The book excels at making history entertaining through humor while still delivering genuine insights about human nature. Phillips demonstrates that while we may think we're more sophisticated than our ancestors, we continue to make the same fundamental mistakes, just with higher stakes and better technology.
