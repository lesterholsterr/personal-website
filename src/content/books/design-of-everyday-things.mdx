*The Design of Everyday Things* is a seminal work that fundamentally changed how I think about the objects and interfaces I interact with daily. Norman's insights into good and bad design are both eye-opening and practical, making this essential reading for anyone involved in creating anything that people use.

The book's central thesis is that when people have trouble using something, it's usually not their fault - it's a design problem. Norman introduces key concepts like affordances (what actions an object suggests), signifiers (indicators of where action should take place), and mapping (the relationship between controls and their effects) that provide a framework for understanding design.

What I found most valuable was Norman's emphasis on human psychology in design. He explains how people form mental models of how things work and why designs should match these natural thought processes. The discussion of how people handle errors and the importance of making systems forgiving was particularly insightful.

The examples throughout the book are perfect for illustrating Norman's points. From confusing door handles to poorly designed stoves, he shows how bad design creates unnecessary confusion and frustration. The door example (push or pull?) has become so iconic that poorly designed doors are now called "Norman doors."

Norman's six principles of design - visibility, feedback, constraints, mapping, consistency, and affordances - provide a practical checklist that I now find myself applying not just to digital interfaces but to everything around me. These principles are simple to understand but profound in their implications.

The book isn't just critical of bad design; it also celebrates good design and explains why certain objects work so well. The analysis of how scissors naturally indicate their use, or how a well-designed control panel makes complex operations intuitive, helps illustrate what designers should strive for.

While some examples feel dated (the book was originally published in 1988, though updated editions address this), the core principles remain remarkably relevant, especially in our increasingly digital world. The concepts apply just as well to app interfaces as they do to physical objects.

This book has made me a more conscious user and critic of design. I now notice good and bad design choices everywhere, and I have a vocabulary for articulating why something works well or poorly. For anyone working in user experience, product design, or even just curious about why some things are easier to use than others, this book is indispensable.
