_Crime and Punishment_ is a ‚Äúmurder mystery‚Äù where the reader is in on it from the very beginning. But more than that, it is an exposition of human nature, chronicling the fallout from the murderer‚Äôs guilt driving him to insanity, then confession, then salvation. I think this is one of the most spoiler-proof books there is because there‚Äôs so much nuance and lore behind all of the characters and their actions that you can only understand by listening to the omnipresent narrator that is Dostoevsky. 

The main character‚Äôs name is Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov. Sometimes he is addressed by his last name, sometimes by his first and middle, sometimes by his first, and sometimes by a nickname (Rodya, Rodka). Easy enough to remember, but now add in a dozen other characters each with 3 names and the fact that some nicknames are not clearly relatable back to a first name (Raskolnikov‚Äôs sister‚Äôs first name is Avdotya but is nicknamed Dunya and Dunechka), and now I feel like I‚Äôm back at orientation week trying (and miserably failing) to remember who the hell everyone is. 

Rodya was an intelligent university student whose mother and sister mustered enough money to send him to St. Petersburg to study law. The story begins in medias res, with Rodya forced to drop out due to not being able to afford tuition but continuing to live in Petersburg, unemployed and in poverty. He gets the idea of killing the ‚Äúloan shark‚Äù who he owes money to, meticulously planning the assassination, almost getting caught doing the deed, but improvising and escaping in the end. All this happens in Part 1 of this 6 part book. It was incredibly well written and I haven‚Äôt been that engaged in a novel for a while. As mentioned at the start, the rest of this book is about the aftermath. To be fully transparent, the paragraphs that follow are not my own ideas, but a synthesis of perspectives I found on the internet that I resonated with. 

First, _C&P_ for me is a more effective tale about the dangers of hubris compared to _Frankenstein_ (probably the epitome of ‚Äòdangers of hubris novels‚Äô). I think a lot of readers see at least a part of ourselves in the main character, as is the case in Notes From Underground. Rodya uses his intellect to justify his actions and evade suspicion, but that doesn‚Äôt stop him from suffering the consequences of tormenting guilt. He comes to peace not by thinking his way out of it, but by accepting punishment and in doing so finding salvation and love. tWe‚Äôre all just apes and bad things happen when we reject or forget that. 

Second, this book is an argument against nihilism. Raskolnikov‚Äôs rationale for his crime revolves around the idea that ‚Äúgreat‚Äù people should not be held down by the rule of law: a very ‚Äòends justify the means‚Äô, or utilitarian, mindset. I‚Äôve always regarded utilitarianism as a silly idea, yet I frequently plague myself with nihilistic thoughts. _C&P_ points out a contradiction here. If we cannot use utility as a moral compass, that must mean there is some inherent value in each life, even if none of it will matter once we die. I didn‚Äôt realize how nihilistic Rodya is until the end of the book when he is converted. I think we are all born in a shroud of innocence that gives way to nihilism when confronted with the crude reality of the world. We should be wary not to embrace this cynicism as a higher level of enlightenment, as Rodya (and myself) has done. _C&P_ gives me hope that there is more that lies beyond cynicism. if only I have faith and keep looking.

I know for certain that many aspects of this book went over my head - religious motifs, symbolism, and philosophical ideas to name a few. I often hear people credit this book as the reason they no longer enjoy any other fiction because _C&P_ is that much better than everything else. I don‚Äôt feel that way about this book. So if you are one of those people, feel free to attribute that to my immaturity as a reader and as a human being. I‚Äôll continue enjoying my novels üôÇ. That‚Äôs not to say that I didn‚Äôt thoroughly enjoy this book though. Dostoevsky is the first author to appear twice on my bookshelf. I would not be surprised if he makes a third appearance soon.

IRL Update: My 2B study term is already well under way. Campus is a lot emptier in the summer (which basically just means everything is at capacity rather than over capacity lol), and not having to go through the recruiting cycle has been a blessing. I have high hopes for this term!
