I've been putting off writing this for nearly three months now because anything I write about this book will do it injustice. You simply must read it yourself. I take notes sparingly when I read, often just writing down a couple interesting passages and my thoughts on them. But once I got to the end of Viktor Frankl's *Man's Search for Meaning*, I had 8 pages of notes, quotes, and reflections. I'll share just a few of them here.

The book is split into two halves. In the first half, Frankl describes his experience as a victim of the Nazi concentration camps. In the second half, he outlines his meaning-based approach to therapy known as logotherapy. Frankl states that in life, most people find meaning through their work and their loving relationships. Inside a concentration camp, both of these things are stripped from a man, and he quickly begins to lose hope. Frankl observes that prisoners die not because of the brutal conditions of the camp, but because these brutal conditions made them lose the will to live. It is not the strongest or most physically fit inmate who survives, but the man with the mental fortitude and the ability to wield the one thing that can never be taken away from him: your attitude to the situation. To quote Nietzsche, "he who has a *why* to live can bear almost any *how*."

Frankl compares human suffering to a gaseous substance since it "fills the human soul and conscious mind, no matter whether the suffering is great or little." Every individual is presented with a unique set of sufferings that only he himself can bear the burden of. This is where meaning can be derived from life—even from the barracks of a concentration camp, to hold one's head high, to see things in a humorous light, to remain brave, dignified, and unselfish… **to be worthy of your sufferings**.

Why does this book deserve a 9.8/10 rating? In my previous school term (January to April), one of the things keeping me going was the prospect of being able to somewhat relax over the summer. I was looking forward to dedicating more time to hobbies and intellectual pursuits of topics that piqued my interest in recent months. But as it turns out, working, commuting, and taking an online course (ECON101) meant not much spare time at all. I then became increasingly anxious about what life post-graduation would look like. If a 9-to-5 sucks up so much of your time, will I have to wait until retirement to truly "enjoy" life*? Throughout May, as this reality that fell way short of my expectations began to set in, my mental state was decimated. I cried more times than I can count on two hands. This book helped me focus on the present, step up to the challenge, and take things one day at a time. It did not change the fact that these past four months have undoubtedly been the hardest of my life thus far, but it did change the attitude that I had, the actions I took, and thus the things I accomplished.

> The pessimist resembles a man who observes with fear and sadness that his wall calendar, from which he daily tears a sheet, grows thinner with each passing day. On the other hand, the person who attacks the problems of life actively is like a man who removes each successive leaf from his calendar and files it neatly and carefully away with its predecessors, after first having jotted down a few diary notes on the back. He can reflect with pride and joy on all the richness set down in these notes, on all the life he has already lived to the fullest. What will it matter to him if he notices that he is growing old? Has he any reason to envy the young people whom he sees, or wax nostalgic over his own lost youth? What reasons has he to envy a young person? For the possibilities that a young person has, the future which is in store for him? "No, thank you," he will think. "Instead of possibilities, I have realities in my past, not only the reality of work done and of love loved, but of sufferings bravely suffered. These sufferings are even the things of which I am most proud, though these are things which cannot inspire envy.

**IRL Update (08/17/2023)**: It's the second last week of my first university internship, which has been an amazing experience to say the least. I'm going to spend a lot more time writing these next few weeks before school starts again.

*I don't mean to say that my internship was not enjoyable, because it was. But a full time job is a responsibility. Some days I wake up looking forward to work while other days I'd much rather sleep and watch some movies. That doesn't change what I'm going to be doing from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. In my opinion, the proverb "find a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life" doesn't hold true in the days when I simply don't want to do anything (does that mean I don't love my job enough?). As long as your name is in the employee registry of a company, it seems impossible to have the ability to do what you want, when you want. Perhaps this is a naive idea, but that's what I mean by "truly 'enjoy' life."
