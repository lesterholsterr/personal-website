# personal-website

*Written on August 18th, 2025*

Almost exactly three years ago, I bought the domain matthewyang.ca and shared my first personal website with the world. Back then, I had just finished my senior year of high school. I spent my 9-5 working a remote internship and the rest of my time playing the piano, simultaneously worrying and looking forward to university, and building out my cute HTML/CSS website. Oh, how times were simpler then... 

Today, I'm updating the DNS settings for my domain to point to Vercel name servers, where this new portfolio is hosted. I quite literally built my old website brick by brick. ChatGPT wouldn't be released for another five months, and so I styled every flexbox and chose every hexcode with intentionality. On the other hand, thanks to agentic coding tools, I barely understand how entire React components work in this new website. 

I see my personal website as a part of me â€” the part of me that lives on the internet. In that light, it seems I have relinquished another part of myself to our soon-to-be robot overlords. On the bright side, the new site does look a lot cooler. Perhaps that's not such a bad tradeoff :P

TL;DR: This vibe coded website is replacing my old portfolio website.
